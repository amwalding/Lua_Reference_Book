# Lua_Reference_Book
Hello everyone.  In all my Wireshark courses, I provide a reference "booklet" for Lua.
This repository is very simply that PDF document.
It is literally cobbled together Lua stuff if you are interested in wandering down that path.
Please do not ask for support on this.
I am no Lua expert.
But I hope this helps get you started with Lua.
Best
Andy
