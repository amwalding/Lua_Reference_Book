# Lua_Reference_Book
Hello everyone.  In all my Wireshark courses, I provide a reference "booklet" for Lua.

This repository is very simply that PDF document.  It is literally cobbled together Lua stuff if you are interested in wandering down that path.
Viewing the document here probably wont help much.  If you download the PDF however, the links all work so you can view embedded videos and such.

Please do not ask for support on this.  I am no Lua expert.  But I hope this helps get you started with Lua.
Best
Andy
